# Category Total Rounding Fix Summary

## Problem Description

The category totals in the summary table were displaying with many decimal places instead of being rounded to two decimal places, making them difficult to read and inconsistent with the overall summary display (income, expenses, net) which were already properly formatted.

## Root Cause Analysis

### The Problem

The `get_category_summary` function in `core/data_processor.py` was calculating the sum of amounts for each category but not rounding the results to two decimal places. This caused the category totals to display with excessive decimal precision.

### Example Scenario

- Category "Groceries" with transactions: -50.123456, -25.789012, -10.456789
- Total calculation: -86.369257
- **Problem**: Displayed as -86.369257 instead of -86.37

## Solution Implemented

### Updated get_category_summary Function

Added rounding to two decimal places for the Total column:

```python
def get_category_summary(dataframe):
    """
    Calculates the sum of 'Amount' for each 'Category', sorts them,
    and returns a summary DataFrame.
    """
    # ... existing validation code ...

    # Group by 'Category', sum the 'Amount', and make it a DataFrame again
    amounts = pd.to_numeric(categorized_df["Amount"], errors="coerce").fillna(0)
    summary = (
        categorized_df.groupby("Category").agg(Total=("Amount", "sum")).reset_index()
    )

    # Round the Total column to two decimal places
    summary["Total"] = summary["Total"].round(2)

    # Sort by amount to see the biggest items first
    summary = summary.sort_values(by="Total", ascending=True)

    return summary
```

## How the Fix Works

### Rounding Implementation

1. **Calculate Totals**: The function calculates the sum of amounts for each category
2. **Apply Rounding**: Uses `summary["Total"].round(2)` to round all totals to 2 decimal places
3. **Maintain Data Type**: Keeps the values as floats (not strings) for proper charting and sorting
4. **Consistent Display**: Ensures all category totals display with consistent 2-decimal precision

### Example Walkthrough

1. Category "Groceries" with transactions: -50.123456, -25.789012, -10.456789
2. Sum calculation: -86.369257
3. Rounding applied: -86.37
4. Display result: -86.37

## Key Improvements

### 1. **Consistent Formatting**

- Category totals now match the formatting of overall summaries (income, expenses, net)
- All monetary values display with 2 decimal places
- Improved readability and professional appearance

### 2. **Data Integrity**

- Maintains float data type for proper mathematical operations
- Preserves sorting functionality
- Compatible with charting operations

### 3. **User Experience**

- Cleaner, more readable display
- Consistent with standard financial reporting practices
- Professional appearance

## Benefits of the Fix

1. **Improved Readability**: Category totals are now easy to read with consistent decimal places
2. **Professional Appearance**: Matches standard financial reporting formats
3. **Consistency**: All monetary values in the app now display with 2 decimal places
4. **Maintained Functionality**: Sorting, charting, and calculations continue to work correctly

## Testing Recommendations

To verify the category total rounding works correctly:

1. **Load data with decimal amounts** (e.g., transactions with cents)
2. **Analyze the data** to categorize transactions
3. **Check category summary table** - totals should display with 2 decimal places
4. **Verify consistency** with overall summaries (income, expenses, net)
5. **Test sorting** - totals should sort correctly with rounded values
6. **Test charting** - chart should display correctly with rounded values

## Files Modified

- `core/data_processor.py`: Added rounding to `get_category_summary()` function

## Status

âœ… **FIXED**: Category totals now display with 2 decimal places, providing consistent and professional formatting throughout the application.

## Related Features

This fix complements the existing formatting:

- **Overall Summaries**: Already properly formatted with `:,.2f`
- **Category Totals**: Now properly rounded to 2 decimal places
- **Chart Display**: Uses the rounded values for consistent visualization
